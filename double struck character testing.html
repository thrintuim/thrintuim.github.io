  <h1>JAWS Functionality Testing for double struck characters</h1>
  <p>The following are examples of how JAWS announces double struck characters. The expectation is that they will be announced as double struck and the letter. Using NVDA and MathPlayer these characters in MathML are announced as their set representation.</p>
  <p>These equations contain double struck characters.</p>
  <p><math><mi>&#x2102;</mi></math> is the symbol for the set of complex numbers <br>
      <math><mi>&#x2115;</mi></math> is the symbol for the set of counting numbers <br>
      <math><mi>&#x211A;</mi></math> is the symbol for the set of rational numbers <br>
      <math><mi>&#x211D;</mi></math> is the symbol for the set of all real numbers <br>
      <math><mi>&#x2124;</mi></math> is the symbol for the set of integers </p>
  <p>These are double struck characters as text.</p>
